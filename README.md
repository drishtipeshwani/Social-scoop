# Social-scoop
Social scoop is a decentralized photo-sharing app where users can post their photos, and other users can tip them with cryptocurrency to appreciate their content.
It is based on the Ethereum blockchain and uses IPFS to store the photos and the ReactJs framework for the client-side application.
